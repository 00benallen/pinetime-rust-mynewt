# How This Application Was Created

The Windows version of the `newt` command-line tool in `newt\newt.exe` was created from 

`https://github.com/lupyuen/mynewt-newt`

The Mynewt application was originally based on: 

`https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/tutorials/sensors/sensor_thingy_lis2dh12_onb.html`

`https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/tutorials/sensors/sensor_nrf52_bno055.html`

```bash
cd /mnt/c
newt new stm32bluepill-mynewt-sensor
cd stm32bluepill-mynewt-sensor
cat project.yml

newt install
newt pkg new -t app apps/my_sensor_app
newt pkg new -t lib libs/semihosting_console

newt target create bluepill_boot
newt target set bluepill_boot bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/bluepill
newt target set bluepill_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot
newt target set bluepill_boot build_profile=optimized

newt target create bluepill_my_sensor
newt target set bluepill_my_sensor bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/bluepill
newt target set bluepill_my_sensor app=apps/my_sensor_app
newt target set bluepill_my_sensor build_profile=debug
```

`project.yml` should contain

```yaml
project.name: "my_project"

project.repositories:
    - apache-mynewt-core

repository.apache-mynewt-core:
    type: github
    vers: 1.6.0
    user: apache
    repo: mynewt-core
```
