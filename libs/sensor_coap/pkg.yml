# Initialisation functions to be called by sysinit() during startup.
# Mynewt consolidates the initialisation functions into sysinit()
# and calls them according to the Stage number, highest number first.
# Stage 500 is used by Sensor Creator so we use Stage 600 onwards.
# Generated sysinit(): bin/targets/bluepill_my_sensor/generated/src/bluepill_my_sensor-sysinit-app.c

pkg.init:
    # sensor_coap should be initialised after esp8266 (Stage 650)
    init_sensor_coap: 660  # Call init_sensor_coap() to initialise the Sensor CoAP module during startup
